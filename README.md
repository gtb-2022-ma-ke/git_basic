# Welcome to Mark's org
Hi, I'm mark and this is my org. I'm newbie in software development. However, I have long programing experience since middle school. I once take part in NOIP competition. And I changed my major when working in master program from statisic to data science.
I have many hobbies. Sports like basketball, football and badminton, are my favourite, but sometimes I lack buddies to play them. I also like watching animations and movie. When I study in Australia, I watch at least one movie in cinema.
These are my garage kit:
